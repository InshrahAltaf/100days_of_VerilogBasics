# 100days_of_VerilogBasics
This repository tracks my 100-day RTL challenge, where I design and implement digital modules from Digital Logic Design (DLD) and Digital System Design (DSD) using Verilog/VHDL. Tools like Xilinx ISE and ModelSim will be used for synthesis, simulation, and performance analysis.
