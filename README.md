# 100days_of_VerilogBasics
This repository tracks my 100-day RTL challenge, where I design and implement digital modules from Digital Logic Design (DLD) and Digital System Design (DSD) using Verilog/VHDL. Tools like Xilinx ISE and ModelSim will be used for synthesis, simulation, and performance analysis.
Welcome to my 100 Days of RTL (Register Transfer Level) Challenge! In this repository, I will be documenting my journey through 100 days of designing, learning, implementing, and optimizing various Digital Logic Design (DLD) and Digital System Design (DSD) modules using Verilog/VHDL RTL design principles.
=> Challenge Overview Each day will involve: Implementing a new RTL module Testing and verifying the design Analyzing timing and performance
=> What to Expect: Sequential and Combinational Circuits: Flip-flops, Counters, Multiplexers, ALU, etc. Finite State Machines (FSMs): Design and implementation of various FSMs for control logic. Synthesis and Simulation: RTL-to-Gates synthesis, functional and timing simulation. Optimization Techniques: Power, performance, and area optimization of RTL designs. Hardware Description Languages (HDL): Primarily using Verilog/VHDL.
=> Tools & Technologies Verilog / VHDL Xilinx ISE / Vivado ModelSim / Xilinx ISIM Synopsys / Cadence Tools (For DSD explorations)
Follow along as I share code, explanations, and insights from each module I work on. Feel free to contribute, raise issues, or share feedback!
